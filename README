Simple record protocol.
Created to be compatible with Mac OS X based on BSD, therefore there might be some problems with Linux distros.

Installation:
	
	brew install gpg

	chmod u+x outgoing.sh
	chmod u+x incoming.sh
	chmod u+x clean

Usage:

	---------------------------------------------------
	
	./outgoing.sh <filename.txt> <passphrase>    

	Default passphrase is $PASSPHRASE variable. 
	Initially set to "Iloveprogramming".

	- Creates new temporary directory with name specified in outgoing.sh as $TEMP_DIR
		default dir name is /out
	- Splits files into smaller files of maximum size of 1000 lines
	- Zips files
	- Calculates MD5 and appends it to the end of the file
	- Encrypts file with <passphrase>

	---------------------------------------------------

	./incoming.sh <passphrase>

	Default passphrase is $PASSPHRASE variable.
	Initially set to "Iloveprogramming".

	- Attempt to decrypt all files from temporary directory
		default dir name is /out
	- Extracts appended MD5 sum and calculated MD5 for this file without appended sum
	- Unzips files
	- Concatenates files to one and puts in decrypted.txt

	---------------------------------------------------

	./clean

	Cleans temporary directory.
	Default dir name is /out

Example:

	./outgoing book.txt "uni.lu"
	./incoming "uni.lu"

	diff book.txt decrypted.txt

	Diff should yield nothing, meaning files match perfectly.
